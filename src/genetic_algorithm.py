class GeneticAlgorithm:
    """
    
    This class is responsible for the genetic algorithm.

    `Constructor:`
    - population_size: The size of the population.
    - num_attributes: The number of attributes that will be selected in each chromosome.
    - training_filename: The path of the training file.
    - test_filename: The path of the test file.

    `Enconding:`
        - binary lists, 0 means that the attribute will not be selected, and 1 means that 

            the gene of the attribute_class will be selected. E.g., [0, 1, 0, 1]

        - The list will be converted to a .arff file, to be used in the fitness function.

    `Selection:`
        - Tournament Selection

    `Fitness:`
        - GMNB cross-validation (5 folds), if cross_validation=True
        - GMNB only, if cross_validation=False

    `Crossover:`
        - Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)

    `Mutation`
        - Swap Mutation
