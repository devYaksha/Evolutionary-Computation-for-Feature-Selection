# Evolutionary Computation for Feature Selection --- In construction.

## Introduction

Welcome to my project! I will to introduce you an to my Genetic Algorithm approach to the problem of feature selection in global hierarchical classification.


## Objectives

1. **Two-Objective Fitness Function**: I plan to use a fitness function with two objectives:
   - Candidate Subset Evaluation
   - Number of Selected Features

   By optimizing these objectives simultaneously, i aim to achieve a well-balanced feature selection process.

2. **Curse of Dimensionality**: Generally, the performance of machine learning algorithms (including classifiers) is negatively influenced by increasing the ratio
 between the number of attributes and the number of instances. My goal is to achieve a well-balanced feature selection process to avoid this problem

## Extension to Multi-Label Problems

I believe that an extended version of a method for multi-label problems holds great promise. Multi-label problems involve assigning multiple labels to a single data point, and the feature selection method can be a valuable tool in solving these challenges.

### Extreme Multi-Label Classification

In particular, the approach has the potential to address extreme multi-label classification problems. In such scenarios, the goal is to learn feature architectures and classifiers that can automatically tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. I believe this method can contribute significantly to this field.
