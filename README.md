# Evolutionary Computation for Feature Selection

## Introduction

Welcome to my project! I will to introduce you an evolutionary computation approach for feature selection. My aim is to develop a robust and efficient method that balances the trade-off between candidate subset evaluation and the number of selected features. This approach prevents the search strategy from selecting too many features at once, ensuring the quality of the feature subset.

## Objectives

My project has several key objectives:

1. **Two-Objective Fitness Function**: I plan to use a fitness function with two objectives:
   - Candidate Subset Evaluation
   - Number of Selected Features

   By optimizing these objectives simultaneously, i aim to achieve a well-balanced feature selection process.

2. **GA-H-CFS Approach**: I intend to carry out experiments with the GA-H-CFS approach, exploring various types of crossover and mutation operators. This will help us fine-tune our evolutionary algorithm for feature selection.

3. **Efficiency for High-Dimensional Datasets**: I am interested in investigating whether the BFS-H-CFS algorithm remains efficient for datasets with a significantly higher number of features. This research will help us understand the scalability of our approach.

## Extension to Multi-Label Problems

I believe that an extended version of a method for multi-label problems holds great promise. Multi-label problems involve assigning multiple labels to a single data point, and the feature selection method can be a valuable tool in solving these challenges.

### Extreme Multi-Label Classification

In particular, the approach has the potential to address extreme multi-label classification problems. In such scenarios, the goal is to learn feature architectures and classifiers that can automatically tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. I believe this method can contribute significantly to this field.
